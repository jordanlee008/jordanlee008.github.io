## What is this?
This website is dedicated to ideas, thoughts, and anything else I wish to write down in a somewhat long-form.
Currently, my todo contains a few ideas of posts/ideas that I wish to explore more.
Some example posts that I anticipate making are book reviews, and a few data science studies that I wish to use to educate myself.

## Why do this?
I have been wishing for a while to explore some ideas that have been bouncing around in my head.
This website serves as a way to hold myself accountable for exploring them in a more involved way.
For example, the book reviews I wish to write are a way to incentive fully internalizing the ideas authored.
Additionally, the project posts will give me a platform to explore some small ideas I've had.

## When will I do this?
Hopefully once a month or so I will write a post.
At minimum I will hold myself to once a quarter.

First post down!
Hope to write you soon Jordan!
