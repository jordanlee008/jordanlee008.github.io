## Summer Internship at Symbotic
During the summer following my freshman year, I interned at Symbotic, a warehouse automation company, on their Data Engineering, Design, and Automation team.
In the 11 weeks of my internship, I developed testing and monitoring tools for the team's Elastic stack pipeline using Metricbeat and Magnus Baeck's Logstash Verifier.
Additionally, during my free time, I refactored a Slack bot using Slack's Event API and Botkit in Node.js to Slack's RTM and Web API using Python.

## Teaching Assistant at AwesomeMath Summer Program
After high school, I returned to a summer math program as I had for many years prior, but not as a student.
I spent 6 weeks at Cornell University, teaching students between the ages of 10 and 16 in algebra and combinatorics classes.

## Summer Research at Research Science Institute
One of 80 rising seniors selected from an international applicant pool to conduct high-level research supervised by graduate students and professors at MIT and Harvard.
I completed a research project in the field of topology, titled "Stability of Finite Difference Schemes on the Diffusion Equation with Discontinuous Coefficients" under the guidance of Sungwoo Jeong at Department of Mathematics at MIT.
