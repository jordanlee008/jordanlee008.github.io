## Summer Internship at Symbotic
During the summer following my freshman year, I interned at Symbotic, a warehouse automation company, on their Data Engineering, Design, and Automation team.
In the 10 weeks of my internship, I developed testing and monitoring tools for the team's Elastic stack pipeline using Metricbeat and Magnus Baeck's Logstash Verifier.
Additionally, during my free time, I made a Slack bot using botkit in Javascript.

## Summer Research at Research Science Institute
One of 80 rising seniors selected from an international applicant pool to conduct high-level research supervised by graduate students and professors at MIT and Harvard.
I completed a research project in the field of topology, titled "Stability of Finite Difference Schemes on the Diffusion Equation with Discontinuous Coefficients" under the guidance of Sungwoo Jeong at Department of Mathematics at MIT.
